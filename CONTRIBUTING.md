# Ansibullbot Contributor's Guide

## Python compatibility

Ansibullbot is compatible with Python 3.8+.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a feature branch
4. Optionally: create a [Python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
4. Install the python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Create the log file:
    * either add `--log path/to/file.log` to the `triage_ansible.py` below
    * or use `sudo touch /var/log/ansibullbot.log && sudo chmod 777 /var/log/ansibullbot.log`
6. Create the config file, copy [`examples/ansibullbot.cfg`](https://github.com/ansible/ansibullbot/blob/master/examples/ansibullbot.cfg) to one of these paths:
    * `~/.ansibullbot.cfg`
    * `$CWD/ansibullot.cfg`
    * `/etc/ansibullot/ansibullbot.cfg`
    * define `ANSIBULLBOT_CONFIG` environment variable where the configuration file is located
7. fill in the credentials

## Testing your changes

Run with `verbose`, `debug` and `dry-run` ...

```bash
./triage_ansible.py --debug --verbose --dry-run
```

## Testing changes to BOTMETA.yml

1. Download [`BOTMETA.yml`](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/.github/BOTMETA.yml) to a local directory
2. Edit the file with whatever changes you want to make.
3. Run `triage_ansible.py` with `--botmetafile=<PATHTOFILE>`.

If you have a specific issue to test against, use the `--id` parameter to speed up testing.

## Testing changes related to a single label

The `--id` parameter can take a path to a script. The `scripts` directory is full of scripts that will return json'ified lists of issue numbers. One example is the `scripts/list_open_issues_with_needs_info.sh` script which scrapes the github UI for any issues with the needs_info label. Here's how you might use that to test your changes to ansibullbot against all issues with needs_info ...

```
./triage_ansible.py --debug --verbose --dry-run --id=scripts/list_open_issues_with_needs_info.sh
```
