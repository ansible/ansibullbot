Thanks @{{ submitter }} for this PR. This module is maintained by the Ansible core team, so it can take a while for patches to be reviewed. Thanks for your patience.

Core team: please review according to guidelines (http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_checklist.html) and comment with 'needs_revision' or merge as appropriate.
